abstract = "A Vehicular Social Network (VSN) is an emerging field of communication where relevant concepts are being borrowed from two different disciplines, i.e., vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) and mobile social networks (MSNs). This emerging paradigm presents new research fields for content sharing, data dissemination, and delivery services. Based on social network analysis (SNA) applications and methodologies, interdependencies of network entities can be exploited in VSNs for prospective applications. VSNs involve social interactions of commuters having similar objectives, interests, or mobility patterns in the virtual community of vehicles, passengers, and drivers on the roads. In this paper, considering social networking in a vehicular environment, we investigate the prospective applications of VSNs and communication architecture. VSNs benefit from the social behaviors and mobility of nodes to develop novel recommendation systems and route planning. We present a state-of-the-art literature review on socially-aware applications of VSNs, data dissemination, and mobility modeling. Further, we give an overview of different recommendation systems and path planning protocols based on crowdsourcing and cloud-computing with future research directions."

In particular, the number of links attached to a node is positively correlated to that of its nearest neighbours. We develop a model that reproduces this feature, starting from microscopical mechanisms of growth. The statistical properties arising from the simulations are in good agreement with those of the real-world social networks of scientists co-authoring papers in condensed matter physics. Moreover, the model highlights the determinant role of correlations in shaping the network's topology."

abstract = "The term assortativity indicates the tendency, for a network node, to be directly connected to other nodes that are someway similar. In more technical terms, a given feature is assortative in a network if the probability that an arc exists between two nodes having this feature is greater than the probability that an arc exists between two generic nodes. The role of assortativity in real-world and online social networks has been largely investigated in the literature, in which, starting from degree assortativity, several forms of assortativity have been analyzed. When moving from a single-social-network to a multiple-social-network perspective, new specific traits can be studied, also under the assortativity magnifying glass. This is the case of membership overlap among networks (i.e., the fact that people belong to more online social networks) as expression of different traits of users×³ personality. In this paper, we deal with the above issue, by defining two different measures of membership overlap assortativity, called Loose and Constrained Inter-social-network Assortativity, respectively and by observing that in two of the most representative online social networks, namely Facebook and Twitter, membership overlap is assortative."
